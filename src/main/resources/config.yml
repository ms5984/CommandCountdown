# Should arguments be treated with case sensitivity? This should stay false in most cases
args-case-sensitive: false

default-limits:
  ### Config example!
#  "auctionhouse:ah":
#    args: ["sell", "*"]
#    limit: 5

  # Note: you can specify the prefix of a plugin in case multiple define the same alias.
  # This is not required but is available as a convenience.
  # the wildcard "*" matches ANY further input (including third, forth argument)

  ### Simple example
  sethome:
    args: []

  ### This would limit players to run /sethome *once*
  # Things to note:
  # * Limit takes effect whether
