##### Settings #####
# Should arguments be treated with case sensitivity? This should stay false in most cases
args-case-sensitive: false

# Should we manually process commands for players and keep original count on failures?
## This feature prevents counts from incrementing when a command fails for a player.
## It uses the boolean result of Command#execute, which might not return false in all
## types of "failure" (no permissions, etc). If you want EVERY potential command execution
## to be counted against the player, set this to false.
keep-count-on-failure: true

# Should limits with fewer args than given also match?
# ### Warning: false not fully implemented at the moment.###
## This setting decides whether not the counters and commands run match like the following:
## -rule: cmd='auctionhouse:ah' args:[sell]
## -cmd1: /ah sell 10 5 # true = match
## -cmd2: /ah sell 10 5 # false = won't match
match-all-args: true

##### Default limit configs are found under the `CommandCountdown/commands` folder #####
