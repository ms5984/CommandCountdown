## Config
#### Settings
```yaml
# Should arguments be treated with case sensitivity? This should stay false in most cases
args-case-sensitive: false

# Should we manually process commands for players and keep original count on failures?
## This feature prevents counts from incrementing when a command fails for a player.
## It uses the boolean result of Command#execute, which might not return false in all
## types of "failure" (no permissions, etc). If you want EVERY potential command execution
## to be counted against the player, set this to false.
keep-count-on-failure: true

# Should limits with fewer args than given also match?
# ### Warning: false not fully implemented at the moment.###
## This setting decides whether not the counters and commands run match like the following:
## -rule: cmd='auctionhouse:ah' args:[sell]
## -cmd1: /ah sell 10 5 # true = match
## -cmd2: /ah sell 10 5 # false = won't match
match-all-args: true
```
#### Default limit syntax
```yaml
default-limits:
# Rich example
  "auctionhouse:ah":
    pluginname: auctionhouse
    label: ah
    args: ["sell", "*"]
    limit: 5
    uses:
      playerid: 0 # 0 = count
# Description: matches any alias of 'ah' from plugin 'auctionhouse'
#  with two args: 'test', and a wildcard match for the second
# Allow 5 executions of the command
#  'uses' map stores player uses; no need to create this by hand

# Simple example
  sethome:
    args: []
    limit: 1
# Description: Allow only one execution of the first match for
#  command 'sethome' with arg match according to match-all-args.

# Autogenerated example
  "org.bukkit.command.PluginCommand(ah, AuctionHouse v2.1.12)":
    pluginname: auctionhouse
    label: ah
    args: []
    limit: 5
# Explanation: A String representation of the exact command is
#  captured and used to match that command in the future.
#  plugin name and label are also captured to assist with
#  resolution following version changes
```
